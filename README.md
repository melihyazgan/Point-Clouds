# Point-Clouds
This is the repository for the important implementations of processing/training of Lidar Data
## PointNet
PointNet is a popular deep learning architecture that can directly process unordered point clouds.   
It uses shared multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn local and global features from the points and combines them to perform object detection.   
You can find the pape here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf. Here is the [Implementation](PointNet.ipynb).
